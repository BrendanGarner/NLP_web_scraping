The goal is to extract information from a recently released announcement, search previous announcements for more information and eventually analyse historical data submitted to the Department of Mines on the area in area in question. The names of the company directors can easily be obtained and a sentiment analysis could be conducted on their reputation using sources such as Twitter, Hotcopper and Google.

With timely analysis of data, investors can act swiftly to take advantage of trading opportunities as they arise.

The project is currently able to crawl through the websites of all the companies in the ASX Gold Companies list. The script is designed to look for announcement going back to 2010 that are related to exploration programs. Two different Natural Language Processing Techniques (NLP) are applied - Named Entity Recognition and keyword extraction. Both of the NLP techniques employed by the project require further development.
